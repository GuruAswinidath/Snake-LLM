# Snake-LLM-ASCII Art Generator

# Overview
AutoSnake is a Python-based project that converts images into ASCII art. The program splits an input image into regions and maps the grayscale values of these regions to characters, forming an ASCII representation of the original image. The tool supports custom configurations for image regions and offers flexibility in image formatting.

# Features
Image to ASCII Conversion: Converts an image into ASCII format by analyzing grayscale pixel values.
Customizable Image Splitting: Allows users to configure the size of the regions the image will be split into, making the output more flexible.
Character Mapping: Generates character mappings based on grayscale values for more accurate ASCII representation.

# Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
PIL (Pillow): For image processing and manipulation.
NumPy: Used for efficient handling of image data.
Google Generative AI (optional): Integrated for additional functionality.
